Hi. Thanks for checking out this repository.

I've played around with some basic functional programming implementations in Python and Javascript over the years. Recently, I decided to take the goat by the horns and learn Haskell, which comes highly recommended for Functional Programming.

As part of my efforts to learn by doing, I'm solving Functional Programming problems on [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/domains/fp).

Also, using these resources:
- [Functional Education](http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html) - Blog Post
- [cis194 Spring 2013](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) - Course
- [NICTA](https://github.com/NICTA/course/) - Course
- Haskell - The Craft of Functional Programming - Book

Cheers.
